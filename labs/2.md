# Step 99: Lab Cleanup and Next Steps

We've provided a lab cleanup script that you can execute within your Cloud9 environment that will remove all AWS resources you created as part of the lab once you're done. It will help make sure you don't pay any more than you have to.

> **WARNING**
>
> This step cannot be reversed. All progress in the lab will be lost and you'll need to start again at [Getting Started](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/cisco-application-first-security-lab/README.md#getting-started).

1. Return to the Cloud9 IDE and access a terminal tab in the bottom right pane.

  <p align="center"><img src="https://app-first-sec.s3.amazonaws.com/lab-guide.assets/image-20191017202329590.png" alt="image-20191017202329590" width="50%" /></p>

2. Run the provided _labcleanup_ script to remove all AWS resources.

	###### Command

	```
	labcleanup
	```

	###### Output

	```
	This script will remove all of the AWS objects created as part of this lab. This action can not be undone.

	AWS CloudFormation Stack: cisco-app-first-sec"
	AWS S3 Bucket for Flow Logs: name-of-flow-logs-bucket"
	AWS S3 Bucket for Tetration agent installer: name-of-tetration-agent-bucket"
	AWS EC2 Key Pair: cisco-app-first-sec-cloud9"

	Type 'delete' if you're sure you want to permanently delete these AWS resources: delete
	...
	Lab cleanup will continue in the background. This Cloud9 environment will stop working very shortly.
	```

**Congratulations! You've Completed App-First Security lab!**
