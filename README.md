# Cisco Application-First Security Lab

You're about to start on a doozy of lab that covers a lot of ground in a short time. Buckle in and get ready to secure a cloud-native application and public cloud infrastructure using Cisco Products: Tetration, Stealthwatch Cloud, and Duo. You'll stage the infrastructure, modify and deploy the application, instrument the security products into the environment. In the process, you'll get your hands dirty with products and technologies including git, Kubernetes, Docker, AWS and others.
